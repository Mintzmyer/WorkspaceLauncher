# Linux Implementation: WorkspaceLauncher

## Launcher.sh
---------------------------------------------------------------------
 This script saves and launches preset desktop/program configurations
     referred to as 'Workspaces'. Often, different tasks will require
     different sets of applications and a developer may have specific
     layouts they prefer.

 The goal is to save time and tedium by allowing developers to launch
     a series of programs/files automatically, positioned and set up.

 This file predominantly contains interface and control logic, saving
     and opening workspace functionality is implemented separately
     
---------------------------------------------------------------------

### OpenWorkspace.sh
---------------------------------------------------------------------
 This script handles the functionality for opening a preset workspace
     layout; starts programs, resizes and relocates windows, etc
     
---------------------------------------------------------------------

### SaveWorkspace.sh
---------------------------------------------------------------------
 This script handles the functionality for saving the current desktop
     layout; programs, window sizes and locations, etc
