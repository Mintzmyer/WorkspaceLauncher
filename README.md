# WorkspaceLauncher
 Command line program to launch user-set workspaces, ie the programs/
     files relevant to a user-defined task type

### Summary
 The program saves and launches preset desktop/program configurations
     referred to as 'Workspaces'. Often, different tasks will require
     different sets of applications and a developer may have specific
     layouts they prefer.

 The goal is to save time and tedium by allowing developers to launch
     a series of programs/files automatically, positioned and set up.

### Linux/Mac/Windows
 Multi-platform, each reading from a commonly legible savefile format
     for workspace preferences
